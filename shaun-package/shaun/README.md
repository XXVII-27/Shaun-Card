# shaun â€” Terminal Portfolio

An interactive **business card in your terminal**. After installing, run `shaun` to browse skills, projects, a timeline, a humble investment snapshot, design samples, and fun easter eggs.

> Friendly face, undeniable receipts.

## Install (local dev)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/shaun.git
cd shaun
python -m pip install --upgrade build

Module mode also works:
